# A FAIR workflow platform for biodiversity digital twins

This FAIR workflow platform is developed as a solution
for executing and sharing [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reuseable)
workflows across research domains.
It allows to execute and reuse machine-actionable workflows and resulting data,
encapsulated in [Research Object Crates (RO-Crates)](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)
and advertised via [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/).

## Features

- **Login via ORCID**
- **Workflow Execution** Integrates with [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) for workflow execution.
- **RO-Crate compatibility**: End-To-End integration of RO-Crates
- **Digital Object Management**: Workflows and datasets are stored as Digital Objects using [Cordra](https://www.cordra.org/)
- **FAIR Signposting** on the frontend allows for integration of results into the semantic web.

## Architecture Overview


The workflow platform employs a microservice architecture allowing components to be extended or replaced for flexibility.

- **Frontend**: User-facing interface for submitting workflows and viewing datasets.
- **Digital Object Repository**: [Cordra](https://www.cordra.org/)-based system for storing and managing datasets as FAIR Digital Objects
- **Submission Service**: Handles orchestration between frontend, digital object repository and the workflow service.
- **Workflow Service**: A workflow execution engine for executing workflows.

## Modules

- [**Frontend**](https://github.com/dnlbauer/FAIR-workflow-platform-frontend): Django-based frontend
- [**Cordra schema**](https://github.com/dnlbauer/FAIR-workflow-platform-cordra-schema): Schemas and metadata models for the digital object Repository
- [**Argo Workflow Connector**](https://github.com/dnlbauer/FAIR-workflow-platform-argo-connector): An implementation of the `Submission service` that orchestrates workflows in Argo
- [**Crop wild relatives Workflow RO-Crate**](https://github.com/dnlbauer/cwr-workflow-ro-crate): Sapmle RO-Crate with a workflow that runs the [Crop Wild Relatives prototype Digital Twin](https://github.com/BioDT/uc-CWR). See [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e125192) for details. 

## Deployment at DestinE
